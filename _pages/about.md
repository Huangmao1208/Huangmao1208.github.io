I am a Master of Applied Science student from Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo. My current research focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and computational sprinting.<br>
I believe that sometimes the most remarkable individuals are the ones who fly under the radar. This philosophy is beautifully captured in my favorite movie, <i>The Imitation Game</i>. One quote from the film has resonated deeply with me: <i>"Sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things no one can imagine."</i> These words inspire me to embrace the potential within myself.<br>
I have two lovely cats, Heihei (he/him) and Tutu (she/her).
