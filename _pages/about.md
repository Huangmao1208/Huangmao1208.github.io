I am a <b>Master of Applied Science</b> student from <b>Electrical and Computer Engineering</b>, <b>University of Waterloo</b>. My current research focuses on <b>multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)</b> and <b>computational sprinting</b>.<br>
I believe that sometimes the most remarkable individuals are the ones who fly under the radar. This philosophy is beautifully captured in my favorite movie, <b><i>The Imitation Game</i></b>. One quote from the film has resonated deeply with me: "<i>Sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things no one can imagine.</i>" These words inspire me to embrace the potential within myself.<br>
I have two lovely cats, Heihei (he/him) and Tutu (she/her).
